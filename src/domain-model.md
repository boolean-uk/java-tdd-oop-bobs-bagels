I'd like to know the cost of each filling before I add it to my bagel order.

As the manager,
So we don't get any weird requests,
I want customers to only be able to order things that we stock in our inventory.
 
Do checks and set up an inventory!

11. To keep a record of what I have bought, 
Receipts would be efficient. I would like to see a total cost, the amount of each individual item, their names and cost price.
I would also like the time of the purchase, so that I can trace the transaction, if needed.

| Classes | Methods   | Members     | Scenario                      | Output               |
|---------|-----------|-------------|-------------------------------|----------------------|
| Order   | receipt() | String time | If items are added beforehand | return receipt       |
|         |           | int amount  | If no items are added         | return empty receipt |
|         |           |             |                               |                      |

12. As a customer, i would like some sort of discount when buying multiple items from Bob's Bagels. This could mean meal deals.. or any kind of
discount where i would get rewarded for adding multiple things in my basket.
#### Example orders
```
2x BGLO  = 0.98
12x BGLP = 3.99
6x BGLE  = 2.49
3x COF   = 2.97
           ----
          10.43
```

```
16x BGLP = 5.55
           ----
           5.55
```
| SKU  | Name   | Variant    | Price | Special offers          |
|------|--------|------------|-------|-------------------------|
| BGLO | Bagel  | Onion      | .49   | 6 for 2.49              |
| BGLP | Bagel  | Plain      | .39   | 12 for 3.99             |
| BGLE | Bagel  | Everything | .49   | 6 for 2.49              |
| COFB | Coffee | Black      | .99   | Coffee & Bagel for 1.25 |

Every Bagel is available for the `6 for 2.49` and `12 for 3.99` offer, but fillings still cost the extra amount per bagel.
