- As a poor person living in times with historical inflated price,
    I would like to able to receive a receipt to despair over the high 
    bagle prices and coffee prices
    
- As a customer, I would like to be able to remember
    when and where I bought the bagels

- As a customer, I would like to be able to reach out to the shop
    if any issues might arise after purchase
