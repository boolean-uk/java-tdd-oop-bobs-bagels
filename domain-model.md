# Bob's Bagels - Object-oriented Programming

## Core exercise
```
1.
As a member of the public,
So I can order a bagel before work,
I'd like to add a specific type of bagel to my basket.
```
| Methods            | Member variables      | Scenario | Outputs/Results     |
|--------------------|-----------------------|----------|---------------------|
| boolean addBagel() | ArrayList bagelsList  |          | Add bagel to basket |
|                    |                       |          |                     |


```
2.
As a member of the public,
So I can change my order,
I'd like to remove a bagel from my basket.
```
| Methods                           | Member variables      | Scenario           | Outputs/Results        |
|-----------------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------|------------------------|
| boolean removeBagel(String bagel) | ArrayList bagelsList  | Bagel is in basket | Remove bagel to basket |
|                                   |                       |                    |                        |
|                                   |                       |                    |                        |

```
3.
As a member of the public,
So that I can not overfill my small bagel basket
I'd like to know when my basket is full when I try adding an item beyond my basket capacity.
```
| Methods             | Member variables    | Scenario           | Outputs/Results    |
|---------------------|---------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| boolean addBagel()  | int basketCapacity  | If basket is full  | Print message      |
|                     |                     | If basket not full | Continue as normal |
|                     |                     |                    |                    |

```
4.
As a Bob's Bagels manager,
So that I can expand my business,
Iâ€™d like to change the capacity of baskets.
```
| Methods                              | Member variables   | Scenario                        | Outputs/Results                      |
|--------------------------------------|--------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| int changeBasketCapacity(int change) | int basketCapacity | Increase basket capacity by two | basketCapacity += 2                  |
|                                      |                    | Decrease basket capacity by one | basketCapacity--                     |
|                                      |                    | Try to change capacity to <0    | return basketCapacity, Print message |

```
5.
As a member of the public
So that I can maintain my sanity
I'd like to know if I try to remove an item that doesn't exist in my basket.
```
| Methods                        | Member variables     | Scenario                  | Outputs/Results                     |
|--------------------------------|----------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| void removeBagel(String bagel) | ArrayList bagelsList | If bagelType exist        | Remove bagel to basket, return true |
|                                |                      | If bageltype do not exist | Print message, return false         |
|                                |                      |                           |                                     |
