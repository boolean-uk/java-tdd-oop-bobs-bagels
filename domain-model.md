1.
As a member of the public,
So I can order a bagel before work,
I'd like to add a specific type of bagel to my basket.

```
2.
As a member of the public,
So I can change my order,
I'd like to remove a bagel from my basket.
```

3.
As a member of the public,
So that I can not overfill my small bagel basket
I'd like to know when my basket is full when I try adding an item beyond my basket capacity.
```

|         |                                | String bagel       | If basket not full | Continue as normal |
|         |                                |                    |                    |                    |

As a Bob's Bagels manager,
So that I can expand my business,
Iâ€™d like to change the capacity of baskets.
