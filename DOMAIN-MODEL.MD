6. As a customer,

7. As a customer,

# Extension 1
1. As the manager,
So we that we get more customers,
I want to include special offers to my customers.
Buying 6 bagels of the same variant reduces the total cost to 2.49.
Buying 12 bagels of the same variant reduces the cost to 3.99.
Buying coffee along with a bagel reduces the total cost to 1.25.
Coffee and bagel combo has higher priority than other discounts and applies when there is a one to one mapping.
