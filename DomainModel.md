Design a domain model from the following user stories before developing the application.

## User Stories

```
```
2.
As a member of the public,
So I can change my order,
I'd like to remove a bagel from my basket.
```
```
3.
As a member of the public,
So that I can not overfill my small bagel basket
I'd like to know when my basket is full when I try adding an item beyond my basket capacity.
```
```
4.
As a Bob's Bagels manager,
So that I can expand my business,
Iâ€™d like to change the capacity of baskets.

So that I can maintain my sanity
I'd like to know if I try to remove an item that doesn't exist in my basket.
```
```
6.
As a customer,
So I know how much money I need,
I'd like to know the total cost of items in my basket.
```
```
7.
As a customer,
So I know what the damage will be,
I'd like to know the cost of a bagel before I add it to my basket.
```
```
8.
As a customer,
So I can shake things up a bit,
I'd like to be able to choose fillings for my bagel.
```

9.
As a customer,
So I don't over-spend,
I'd like to know the cost of each filling before I add it to my bagel order.
```
```
10.
As the manager,
So we don't get any weird requests,
I want customers to only be able to order things that we stock in our inventory.
